"mistress_des" = "The mistress wakes up two times at night: the first is as part of the mafia to choose a victim; the second is separately to 'block' someone. The mistress randomly points at one of the players, and if he has an active role (for example, a doctor, a maniac, a journalist), he will not be able to perform it that night.";
